# Joke_Generator-By-Parmanand-Rai-Prd
Throughout my JavaScript learning journey I created a funny project called Joke Generator with responsive UI design and user friendly. I just created main heading and one paragraph tag and one button for output and then apply JavaScript. Project is about Joke generating where I created arrays and saved many jokes. Hope you guys will find it usefull.
Here is live link of project.
